# Proteomics-and-Metabolomics-Integration
This is to test multi-omics integration tools with a proteomics and metabolomics example datasets.

The omics datasets used in this testing 'project' are also used in the article: Harutyunyan et al. 2022 Int. J. Mol. Sci. (https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms23116063).
Proteomics data is available via ProteomeXchange with dataset identifier PXD033987 
Metabolomics data is openly available at https://store.erc.monash.edu/experiment/view/15139/

Code used for testing will be added as the tools are tested out.
